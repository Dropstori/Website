Students are taught to master the skills needed for the job, and school assumes finding the job can be figured out independently. Yet experience counters this, and people infact need more help than we have fashioned our schools to give. What we do, we do for the sole purpose of filling this gap, the gap between skill and the opportunity to use it.</div>
         

          <div class="col service-item-text">For the entrepreneurs, the ones with the courage to embrace the beauty and uncertainty that running your venture presents, we provide a service that helps them access more financing, and when it serves them, we help them pitch to customers as well.</div>
         

          <div class="col service-item-text">Our desire is to see that entrepreneurs can communicate passionately, the value they provide.
